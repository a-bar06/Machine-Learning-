#  Student Performance Tracker – Machine Learning Project

##  Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance using Machine Learning techniques.

The goal is to identify patterns in student data and predict performance outcomes based on features such as:
- Study time
- Attendance
- Scores
- Other academic factors

---

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess student dataset
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize performance trends
- Train Machine Learning models
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

---

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data Loading  
2. Data Cleaning  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Train-Test Split  
5. Model Training  
6. Model Evaluation  

---

##  Results
- Identified key factors influencing student performance
- Compared model performance
- Evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy / RMSE (based on model type)

---

##  Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Deploy as a web application
- Add interactive dashboard
